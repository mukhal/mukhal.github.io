My name is Muhammad Khalifa. I am a first-year PhD student at the Univesrity of Michigan in Ann Arbor. I am co-advised by [Lu Wang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wangluxy/) and [Honglak Lee](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~honglak/). My main research interests are **Generation**, **Representation Learning**, and **Few-Shot Learning**.  Previously, I did my masters in the computer science department at *Cairo University*, where I focused on Low-resource [multi-dialectal Arabic NLU](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2021.eacl-main.65/). Previously, I was an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon AI, supervised by [Miguel Ballesteros](http://miguelballesteros.com/) and [Kathy Mckeown](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kathy/), working on multiple projects including Dialogue Summarization and Semi-structured documents understanding. Prior to that, I was an intern at Naver Labs Europe where I worked on Controllable Text Generation and Energy-based models with [Hady Elsahar](https://www.hadyelsahar.io/) and [Marc Dymetman](https://scholar.google.com.eg/citations?user=D6J5pooAAAAJ&hl=en). Before that, I worked as a Machine learning research engineer at Sypron Solutions under the supervision of Dr. [Alaa Khamis](https://www.alaakhamis.org/), where I investigated **time-series anomaly detection** for preventive maintenance.

On a side note, I'm an avid reader about phsychology, philosophy, and self-improvement. In my freetime, I play the piano, write and produce my own [music](https://soundcloud.com/muhammad-khalifa/sets/1iesbut8u66r).
